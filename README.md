# cribbage
This repo is just a little free-time exercise. It can score cribbage hands, and play a game of cribbage against you as a "dumb NPC". Eventually, it should be able to have some strategies and "intelligence" implemented.

## How to install
Go get this project, then run the main file.

```bash
go get github.com/joshprzybyszewski/cribbage
go run main.go
```

Play cribbage!
